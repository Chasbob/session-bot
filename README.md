## Setup

Make sure to set your Google Calendar to the same timezone as the Discord Bot. In this case, it's the timezone of the Compute Engine on Google Cloud.
**TODO** document makefile and build-config.sh

- save service account creds in `credentials.json`

- create a list of Discord roles to be mentioned in `roles.json`
```json
[ "742344995412347915" ]
```

```
docker build -t session-bot .
cp example.env .env
```

_Make sure to fill the `.env` file with the required fields_

## Run

```
docker run --name session-bot --env-file .env -d session-bot
```

Alternatively build and run with `docker-compose`:
